    "But what about other parts of the UK? One region for studying among some of the top universities, is the East Midlands, which is one of the nine official regions of England in the eastern part of central England.

    "Having experienced and currently still experiencing university life abroad and here in the UK, the focus of this project will be on providing students in the East Midlands some additional information for their life at university. While there are many things to consider when it comes to beginning your studies, one important aspect is the housing situation. For many, it is the first time living away from home, having to take responsibility for paying bills, etc. As such, we will be looking at places to rent, concentrating on the city of Nottingham. In addition, we will investigate other aspects that might be important for students when thinking about the location of their accommodation, such as entertainment, proximity to university, and public transport.

    "For this project, we will require data about the available properties for rent in Nottingham, geo location data, and information about nearby things to do. Thus, we will use datasets from the following sources:\n",

    "1. Data from <a href=https://www.zoopla.co.uk/ rel=\"nofollow\" >Zoopla</a>. Zoopla is one of the UK's largest online real estate portals, where one can find properties for rent and sale. Easy access to these data for further processing are provided through their very own <a href=https://developer.zoopla.co.uk/ rel=\"nofollow\" >Zoopla API</a>. We use the python wrapper <a href=https://pypi.org/project/zoopla/ >Zoopla API</a> as it facilitates working with the API. One limitation that is to note here, is that the Zoopla API limits the size for each page of results to a 100. To have a better working dataset, the API call was repeated a few times for different result pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To plot the properties in their appropriate districts, the <a href='https://www.opendatanottingham.org.uk/dataset.aspx?id=160' >data</a> for the electoral ward boundaries from 2019 for Nottingham City have downloaded as a json file and used in conjunction with a folium map. \n",

    "3. Using the <a href='https://developer.foursquare.com/' >Foursquare City Guide Developer API</a> provides us with things to do in Nottingham, such as a list of places to eat, shop and visit."
